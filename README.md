Every file has to be placed under the same folder and the python packages must be installed - Kivy especially, since this is a kivy-graphics-based project.
As of January 2020 the project was able to run on python 2.7.
*Should* run in Python 3 - some lines of code may have to change due to version difference in syntax.

June 2021 edit: Kivy for Python 3 does not support certain features that used to work on Python 2.
Nonetheless, you may run the code and the logics behind the game still work. Some buttons may not appear properly though, but it's a tough fix so it'll stay for now.
